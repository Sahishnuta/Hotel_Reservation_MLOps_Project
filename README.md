## Problem Statement

**Developing an End-to-End ML Pipeline for Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction**

The project addresses the challenge of predicting whether hotel bookings will be canceled, enabling hotels to:
- Optimize revenue management and room allocation
- Reduce operational costs associated with last-minute cancellations
- Improve customer service and resource planning
- Implement dynamic pricing strategies based on cancellation probabilities

## Key Business Problems:

1. **Revenue Loss Prevention**: Hotel cancellations lead to lost revenue, especially when rooms remain vacant due to late cancellations.

2. **Operational Efficiency**: Hotels need to accurately forecast occupancy rates to manage staff, inventory, and resources effectively.

3. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Manual prediction of cancellations is unreliable; an automated ML system provides consistent, data-driven insights.

## Technical Implementation:

The project solves these problems by building:

- **A comprehensive ML pipeline** that processes hotel booking data
- **Feature engineering** to extract meaningful patterns from booking attributes
- **Multiple model training** with hyperparameter optimization
- **MLOps practices** for model versioning, monitoring, and deployment
- **REST API** for real-time cancellation predictions
- **Monitoring system** to track model performance and data drift

## Data Characteristics:

The system processes booking data including:
- Customer demographics and history
- Booking lead time and duration
- Room type and special requests
- Seasonal patterns and market segments
- Deposit information and customer type

## Expected Outcomes:

- **Accurate cancellation predictions** to optimize overbooking strategies
- **Automated retraining** to adapt to changing booking patterns
- **Scalable deployment** for integration with hotel management systems
- **Continuous monitoring** to maintain model performance over time

This project represents a practical application of MLOps principles to solve a real-world business problem in the hospitality industry.
